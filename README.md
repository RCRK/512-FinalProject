This analysis was part of the final project for the Human Centered Data Science Course. This folder contains analysis related analysis on Influenza trends over the years and effect of vaccine. This is a qualitative and quantitative analysis. 

Data:
Data used for the trending of Influenza like illness is obtained from the following site https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZJZM4F which is public data. The data used is uploaded into the folder in an excel "ILINet_Final Project Data". All processing is done in excel and is documented in the excel

Most of the other research was done on CDC website which is again public information. Additional information gathered is specified in the resources section of the jupyter notebook. 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm - major research was done through the CDC website.

The charts which were leveraged from CDC were appropriately named.

Summary of the Analysis:
I started the analysis with the below three research questions:

1. Is there an increase in Influenza Like Illnesses over the course of the past 19 years?
2. Are all age groups showing a similar behaviour over the years with respect to influenza like illnesses.
3. If there is an Increase or stays neutral how did vaccines influence in reducing this illness.
So my conclusion from the analysis is that the rate of Influenza Like Ilness over the flue season years has not decreased. It has steady steady. Also across the age groups it has been steady over the years. I am a little surprised by the results as my expectation was that the rate would have decreased over the years with the increase in vaccine coverage.

Coming to the third question on the influence of vaccines it was eye opening for me in reading all the research about the effectiveness of the vaccines. Given that I did not see much change in the rate of Influenza like Illness and the increase in vaccine consumption it was more baffling. The research helped me understand the various other aspects associated with the effectiveness of a vaccine and to me I think there is going to be a lot more reasearch on this topic. There is a booming business being built on flu vaccine and as this industry grows there will be more debate on pros and cons.
